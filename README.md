# Description

Steve OS is a revisit of a project I did in high school. Steve OS was a very basic, barebone and simplistic single tasking "operating system" operating in sixteen-bit mode. The original project was written entirely in x86 assembly. However, I was naive back in the day and the source code has been lost. The ISO for the original project will be uploaded under release. 

# Objective

To create a hobby operating system from scratch building upon the aforementioned high school project that I did. I want to bring the project to another level and focus on implementing the following features: 
* 32-bit mode
* file-system (probably fat32, but ideally ext4)
* basic memory management
* have a user interface
* allow the operating system to run simple C programs. 
* decide between a modular or monolithic kernel

# Development and Contribution

The project is something I want to accomplish on my own. It is my own little hobby. So I wont describe the tools needed to participate in development. The repo is public because i dont mind people looking at, forking or downloading the project. However, I do not expect nor do I want contribution from other members of the community.
